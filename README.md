# Arvato-Customer-Identification

Finding new customers for a product is always a challenge. In an ideal world where you have a lot of funds available to acquire new customers, you can run
promotions, discounts, online and offline campaigns to get new customers. However, when you have limited funds and staff hours available, you should narrow down your efforts to a target
segment, which is more probable of buying your products. "If I'm trying to expand sales, I have to find out who my existing customers are. What are their demographics? What do they look like?"
